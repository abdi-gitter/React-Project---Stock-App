## Required Technologies:
- **React.js:** A widely used JavaScript library for building interactive and dynamic user interfaces. React is known for its component-based architecture, making it easy to develop reusable UI elements.
- **Redux-Redux Toolkit:** Redux is a state management library for managing complex application states. Redux Toolkit is a set of tools and best practices that simplify Redux development, making it more efficient and less boilerplate-heavy.
- **Axios:** A popular HTTP client used for making API requests and handling responses. Axios is known for its simplicity and flexibility in managing HTTP requests.
- **Material UI and Tailwind CSS:**
  - **Material UI (MUI):** A comprehensive UI framework that offers a wide range of pre-designed components and themes, making it easier to create a polished and consistent user interface.
  - **Tailwind CSS:** A highly customizable CSS framework that allows you to design and style your application with minimal effort, thanks to its utility-first approach.
- **React Router Dom:** A widely used routing library for React applications. It enables dynamic and intuitive navigation between different pages within your application, making it essential for building a multi-page web app.
- **Formik and Yup:**
  - **Formik:** A library for managing form state, handling form submissions, and providing a streamlined way to work with forms in React.
  - **Yup:** A library used for defining validation schemas for form data, ensuring that user inputs conform to specified constraints. When combined with Formik, it offers robust form validation.
- **Custom Hooks:** Custom hooks are a React feature that allows you to encapsulate and reuse complex logic across different components. They improve code organization, maintainability, and reusability by abstracting away common functionality.

Overall, the combination of these technologies and libraries provides a solid foundation for building a modern and feature-rich web application with a focus on user interface, state management, API integration, form handling, and routing. These tools and best practices are commonly used in the React ecosystem and should help you develop a high-quality application efficiently.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Initialization of Project
1. Create an API for yourself:
   - You can create an API in the Clarusway server through the following steps:
     - To set your API, visit `http://fullstack.clarusway.com/`
     - Select the application as "1 - Stock API (NodeJS)" or "2 - Stock API (Django)" and create your account with your student number.
     - Enter the password as `cwfullstack`
     - Click Start Application
     - Click Set Active
   - Copy your API URL and use it in your application to make CRUD operations

2. Read swagger documentation of API:
   - Visit your API adding /redoc endpoint to the end of URL. For example `https://20004.fullstack.clarusway.com/redoc`
   - Check the endpoints and understand the features of API and its usage.

3. Test API with Postman:
   - Use Postman to test your API endpoints. Ensure that all endpoints are working as expected.

4. Create a React App:
   - Set up a new React project using Create React App or your preferred method.

5. Install the required packages mentioned above:
   - Install the necessary packages like React Router, Material UI, Formik, Yup, and Toastify using npm or yarn.

6. Establish React Router setup:
   - Set up a React Router to handle navigation within your React app.

7. Add Toastify setup:
   - Integrate Toastify to display notifications or messages to the user.

8. **Hint: Adding Manager Role to a User:** 

   When you register a new user, they will initially only have regular client permissions and won't be able to perform any CRUD operations. To grant CRUD permissions, you need to assign a manager role to that user in the API Admin Dashboard. Here are the steps to do so:

   - Visit your API adding /admin endpoint to the end of URL. For example `https://20004.fullstack.clarusway.com/admin`
   - Enter these credentials to login. 
     - Username: *admin*
     - Password: *Clarusway1+*

   - Click on  "Users".
   - Find and click on the user to whom you want to grant the manager role.
   - In the "Groups" section, remove the *Read_Only* role and add the *Manager* role
   - Click the "Save" button at the bottom to apply the changes.


### Task 2: Establish authentication features

2. User Authentication Implementation:
   - Implement user registration and login features by connecting to your API.
   - Use Redux Toolkit to manage application state.
     - Create a Redux store for authentication.
     - Create a Redux slice for authentication, which includes actions and reducers.
     - Implement asynchronous API connections using async actions in Redux Toolkit.
   - Use Toastify to notify users of the registration and login processes.
   - After a successful login, navigate the user to the dashboard.
